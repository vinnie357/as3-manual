# Introduction
[introduction]: introduction

The goal of this manual is to provide a comprehensive understanding of AS3 from
the ground up. The guide is broken up into the following sections that are organized in a suggested reading order.

* [First Declaration](as3_manual.md#first-declaration)

  This is a quick tour of getting AS3 installed, confirming installation, and deploying a first declaration. At the end of this section is a list of links to official documentation that provides more information for getting up and running.

* [AS3 Modes of Operation](as3_manual.md#as3-modes-of-operation)

  An overview of different configuration options for AS3. This is directed at network owners and admins when architecting their control planes.

* [Configuring BIG-IP with AS3](as3_manual.md#configuring-big-ip-with-as3)

  The configuration section provides a primer on AS3 and common BIG-IP configurations. This will be most useful to application owners and network operators that may need to update the configuration of the BIG-IP as new applications are brought online.

* [Templating AS3 with FAST](as3_manual.md#templating-as3-with-fast)  

  The second section will cover some templating strategies, and using F5's FAST templating framework to manage appications within AS3 declarations.

* [Declarative APIs](as3_manual.md#declarative-apis)

  A treatise on Declarative APIs and AS3's API philosophy.

* [Reference](as3_manual.md#reference)

  This section has a glossary, links, and AS3 API reference.
